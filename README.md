## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
-Problem: Struggled most with trying to get genre to display.
-Solved with Kris' help. Myself and Chris from class got stuck at the same problem. We both troubleshooted and isolated the problem to our fetchGenres saga and Kris pointed out we needed an action. 

-Problem: Tried pulling in genre data to get that data to a drop down menu. Did not work. 
Solve: I tested by creating a drop down menu where I hardcoded the genres in the drop down menu and that posted to the database but still having issues pulling in the genres from database to fill in the drop down menu.
